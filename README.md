# ESP32-DW3000-AppleNearbyInteraction
Attempts to get Makerfab's ESP32-DW3000 to work with Apple's Nearby Interaction Service and [Qorvo's Background Nearby Interaction demo app](https://www.qorvo.com/products/d/da008212).

### Library
Using [Makerfab's DW3000 Library for ESP32](https://github.com/Makerfabs/Makerfabs-ESP32-UWB-DW3000).

### Current state
Accessory can be connected to by the demo app, but sends an invalid UWB config.
